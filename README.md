# PuFU (Personal Flying Umbrella)

An attempt to design and build a minimalistic flying vehicle.

![Personal Flying Umbrella](https://github.com/mihaioltean/pufu/blob/main/pictures/personal_flying_umbrella.png)

## Goals

* Lightweight,
* Stability,
* Long autonomy (15 minutes at least),
* Easy to carry,
* Easy to fly with,
* Easy to take off,
* Easy to land with.

## Review of the existing personal flying machines

Most of the existing devices have the following problems:

* The structure is too heavy,
* Heavy structures means more power consumption,
* Flying time is short (~5 minutes),
* The structure has a chair. Why a chair is needed if the flying time is so short!?
* Some have motors at the legs level. This is dangerous.

## Specs

TBD

## BOM

TBD

* 4 BLDC motors,
* 4 propellers,
* 1 gyroscope,
* 2 carbon fibers bars,
* batteries (in the backpack).

## Source code

### Design

Sources are placed inside the [src](src) folder.
You need [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) to compile them.

### Fly control

Source code for fly control and stabilization ... TBD
